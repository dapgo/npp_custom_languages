# NPP_custom_languages (Notepad++)
My user defined languages for Notepad++ focused in CA Clarity PPM - [Highlight Syntax]

The generic highlight definition works for White or Dark background. However I strongly recommend to use the custom defintion for each background color.


# Filename: GEL_XML_SQL_xxxx_bg_vx.xml  
Target code: NSQL, GEL(XML, SQL,), LogFiles

# Filename: my_syntax_Clarityppm_logfiles_vx.x.xml  
Target code: Clarity PPM LogFiles(ca-app.log, bg-ca.log,...)

# Filename: my_syntax_json_selenium_vx.x.xml 
Target code: Selenium (JSON) 

## How to install/Use

# import
1) Open Notepad++, 
2) Menu "Language","Define your language" 
3) Button "Import", choose the file i.e "my_syntax_json_seleniuml_v1.2.xml", 
5) Button "SaveAs..." [Choose a name] i.e "JSON for Selenium/Kantu"

# Highlight code
1) Open a your code/text file 
2) Notepad++, Language, [Choose the previously created language name] i.e "JSON for Selenium/Kantu"

[if you extension file is associated to the language definition then step2 is not required]
