# npp_custom_languages
My user defined languages for Notepad++ focused in CA Clarity PPM - [Highlight Syntax]

The generic highlight definition works for White or Dark background. However I strongly recommend to use the custom defintion for each background color.


# File: GEL_XML_SQL_xxxx_bg_vx.xml  -Target code: NSQL, GEL(XML, SQL,), LogFiles
# File: my_syntax_Clarityppm_logfiles_vx.x.xml  -Target code: Clarity PPM LogFiles(ca-app.log, bg-ca.log,...)
# File: my_syntax_json_selenium_vx.x.xml Target code: Selenium (JSON) 

## How to install/Use

# import
1) Open Notepad++, 
2) Language, 
3) Define your language, 
4) Import, i.e "my_syntax_json_seleniuml_v1.2.xml", 
5) SaveAs... [Choose a name] i.e "JSON for Selenium/Kantu"

# Highlight cod
1) Open a your code/text file 
2) Notepad++, Language, [Choose the previous language] i.e "JSON for Selenium/Kantu"

[if you extension file is associated to the language definition then step2 is not required]
